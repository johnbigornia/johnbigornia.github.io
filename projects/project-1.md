summary: A side project on building a computer one hardware at a time.
---
I spent about a month planning on what parts to buy for this build. The important thing to think about is compatability with the motherboard you are going to use. Second is the approximate wattage the whole system will take. Next, think how well will the hardware be together. You don't want to bottleneck any of your hardware as that will reduce optimization. Imagine funnel. The big opening represents a hardware that is contains very high specifications while thee smaller end represents the low spec. One is taking in all the water, however it ultimately slows down. For specific parts I used on this project, here is a link: https://pcpartpicker.com/user/johnbigo/saved/#view=Q4VLJx
