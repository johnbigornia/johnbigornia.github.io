**Smart Questions**

Smart questions are important when it comes to communicating. Often times asking questions that is very broad such as “Is this right”, the victim will often invoke a reply following the lines of “is what right?”. There is no such thing as a dumb question, but there is such a thing as redundant questions especially undergoing the age of information. Information is shared from one point of the world to the other in a blink of an eye. More than likely the question you want answered is somewhere amongst google. However, there will be some sources of answers that will still remain confusing to some folks that’s where you would have to ask the same question adding in some depth of what things you grasp prior to asking. In relation to Software engineering, this skill is highly important for communication and accuracy of answer.

Here is an example of a good question:
Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array

This person provided more info after the question at hand. Two examples were given as a way to compare and contrast giving the person being ask more information and providing a way to find an answer suit the question. Also with more information being added, we could say the person asking did extra work to find the answer on his own other than seeking from others. 

Here is an example of a Bad question:
Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57919551/extract-two-infromations-in-string

He provides very little detail of the problem at hand. This leads us to back to my first paragraph of asking if this is right. While short questions aren’t necessarily bad, when your asking a question via online you should probably search it up first or at least look like you did. One thing this person could of done was give proof that he tried it by themselves. This ensures them that they won’t make the same mistake later with a bonus on why it didn’t work.
