I am currently brainstorming ideas on what this app will do. In a way, I wanted to do a gamification on saving money. The whole idea is to get students to think finacially sooner than later. I have an idea for the app where it provides an insentive for keeping within their budget for the month or week such as 15 useful tips or tangible rewards. I will update this page when I have more info!
